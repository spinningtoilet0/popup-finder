# Scam Popup Finder
A popup finder written in c#. I don't think I will improve this, but I atleast hope it is good enough for scambaiters.

**I understand that my code is very messy. It really isn't that good. The program is not that smart, and can't detect if it is a actual popup.**

## How to use
When you first load up the exe, click on the options. On the left you can see all the websites to "misspell."
Next to that is the website extensions, (like .com, .net, .org, etc). To the right of that is the basic options.

*Popup Guesses* is the amount of times the program will *guess.*

*Popup Amount* is the amount of *confirmed working websites.*

Timeout is how long the httpClient can wait at maximum for a response,

And the use no numbers option explains itself.



One neat feature is that when you click on save, it stores it in the .exe.config file to be loaded later!
Click on the big "Open last saved settings."

If you wish to not save the config, just click the X to exit.
